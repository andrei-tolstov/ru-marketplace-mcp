"""Unified marketplace MCP server.

One config entry instead of twelve. This server mounts every installed
marketplace connector as a namespaced toolset — ``wb_search``, ``ozon_card``,
``avito_seller`` and the rest keep their names, so client configs and agent
habits carry over untouched, but the operator wires a single ``marketplace``
entry into claude_desktop_config.json instead of one per source.

Each connector is imported defensively: a missing optional dependency (Ozon's
curl_cffi and Playwright, Taobao's Playwright) removes that source's tools
from the set rather than sinking the whole server. compare-prices rides along
as its own namespace (``compare_prices``, ``compare_sources``).

NEVER write to stdout in a stdio MCP server — it corrupts JSON-RPC.

    ## Why this exists

    Connectors are imported defensively, so a missing dependency removes a
    marketplace instead of killing the server. That is the right failure mode,
    but it is invisible from the client: absent tools look the same as a source
    that simply found nothing. Call this before concluding a marketplace has no
    results — if it is in ``skipped``, it was never queried at all.

    ## Return Format

    MarketplaceSourcesResponse: {mounted, skipped, mounted_count, skipped_count,
    capabilities, server_version}. ``skipped`` maps source name to the import error that
    removed it, which is usually a missing optional dependency.

    ## Error Format

    Never raises ToolError: pure introspection of the mounted connectors — a
    failed import is recorded in ``skipped`` instead of being raised.
